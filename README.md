## Contribute to the Magnolia component ecosystem
It's easy to create components for Magnolia and share them on github and npm. I invite you to do so and join the community. Let's stop wasting time by developing the same thing again and again, rather let's help each other out by sharing our work and create a rich library of components.

Just add `magnolia-light-module` as a keyword to npm's package.json to make them easy to find and use on npm.
